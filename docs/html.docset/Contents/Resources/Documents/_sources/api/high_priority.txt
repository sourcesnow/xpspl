****************


.. function:: xp_high_priority($process)


    Registers the given process to have a high priority.
    
    Processes registered with a high priority will be executed before those with
    a low or default priority.
    
    This registers the priority as *0*.
    
    .. note::
    
       This installs an exhaust of 0.
    
       This is not an interruption.
    
       Before process interrupts will still be executed before a high priority
       process.

    :param callable|process: PHP Callable or \XPSPL\Process.

    :rtype: object Process
